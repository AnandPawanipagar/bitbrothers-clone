        At Bit Brothers, we produce top quality applications. Since 2013, we
        delivered a variety of projects for companies of all sizes â€“ from
        one-person startups to enterprises like HDFC Bank, 3Y Ventures, and
        non-profits. We build client relationships on trust, openly sharing our
        work methods and the rules we rely on.
